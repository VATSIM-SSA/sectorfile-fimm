===== FIMP Pilot Briefing =====

//Pilots taking part in events that depart from or arrive to FIMP should make themselves familiar with this briefing page as well as with all existing charts.//

==== Overview ====

  * FIMP Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Intl is Mauritius' primary international airport. Capable of supporting Airbus A380 operations, it is the hub for Air Mauritius and the main gateway to the island.

==== Departure Briefing ====

=== Clearance Delivery ===

  * FIMP_TWR will be the Position responsible for providing you with a Departure Clearance.
  * For flights taking part in Events, pilots will be given a Cruise Flight Level that allows for en-route separation. It might not match your Requested Flight Level.
  * You may be given a Runway Heading as a Departure Procedure, particularly if departing runway 14, which is the preferred runway for departures.
  * Be aware that there is high terrain West of the aerodrome. Certain departure procedures have specific climb performance requirements. As the pilot, you are responsible to ensure your aircraft is able to meet those requirements (beware of heavy payloads). If unable to meet them, notify the controller.

=== Ground Procedures ===

  * FIMP_TWR will be the Position responsible for providing push-back and taxiing instructions.
  * Be aware that if you require full length for take-off for runway 14, you must request it. Otherwise, you'll be given an intersection departure from holding point A.
  * Remember to squawk Mode C before taxiing.
  * If told to monitor a frequency, you're expected to tune in the frequency but not to contact the controller. He will contact you when able.
  * When approaching the runway, you'll be asked to report fully ready for departure. That means that when given line-up or take-off clearance, you're expected to be ready to do so without delay. If you need more time, please advise the tower.

=== Departure Procedures ===

  * Comply with your assigned departure procedure and do not climb above your initial Climb Altitude unless instructed so.
  * You may be given intermediate climb instructions due to traffic. Do not climb above any assigned flight level.
  * Comply with any speed restrictions if provided. They are important to maintain adequate separation between traffic.

==== Arrival Briefing ====

=== Arrivals and Approaches ===

  * As your flight is approaching FIMP, you should make yourself familiar with the existing Arrivals (STARs), Holding Points and Approaches.
  * Be aware that FIMP has distinct sets of Approaches (ILS, RNAV and VOR) and that they have distinct approach procedures. Controllers will inform you what Approach to expect based on an assigned Arrival. Most likely, during busy events, expect the ILS approach.
  * Be mindful that FIMP's ILS for runway 14 has a glide scope gradient of 3.5ยบ, which is steeper than the standard 3ยบ. Be prepared to adjust your descent rate accordingly. The RNP Z for runway 14 has a 3.3ยบ glide scope gradient.
  * FIMP is a single runway airport, unable to support High Intensity Runway Operations (HIRO), so during Arrival Events, you should expect to Hold.
  * In case of Missed Approach, climb 4000 ft and maintain runway heading. You'll receive further instructions by the Controllers.
  * During busy events, expect to vacate right on D if landing runway 14 or vacate left on A if landing 32.

==== Oceanic Operations ====

  * For Mauritius Oceanic flights, you will not be required to request an Oceanic Clearance.
  * You will be requested however to maintain your Flight Level and an assigned Mach Number.
  * During Oceanic En-route, you'll be able to request higher flight levels, depending on availability.
  * Position Reports will not be required. You may be requested from Oceanic Controllers to provide your ETO (Expected Time Overhead) for a specific waypoint. What the Controller is expecting is your time (as in, 1615z) at the specific waypoint.
  * Remain on your last ATC assigned squawk code until instructed otherwise.
  * CPDLC may available at Mauritius Oceanic, but its availability is up to the Controller.
  * SELCAL is also available at Mauritius Oceanic.
  * SLOP (Strategic Lateral Offset Procedure) is also available at Mauritius Oceanic.
